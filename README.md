# Technician-Polyview

This is a starter application for me while I learn Polymer.

The purpose of me creating this app is for use as a webview within a Rails application.


## Installation

Pretty straight-foward:

```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:PDaily/Technician-Polyview.git
$ npm install
$ bower install
```

## Developement

I've set up a Gruntfile which will simply serve the `index.html` on port `8000`.

To run this:

```
$ grunt
```

And navigate to http://localhost:8000
